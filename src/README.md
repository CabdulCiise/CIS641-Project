# Run Instructions

To set up a virtual environment, navigate to the project src folder on your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

This will create a new virtual environment named .venv. Next, you need to activate the virtual environment by sourcing the activation script:

```bash
.venv/scripts/activate
```

After executing this command, your prompt will change to indicate that youâ€™re now operating from within the virtual environment. After you successfully set up and activated your virtual environment, then run the following to install all packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run either the console app by running

```bash
python ./console.py
```

or the UI and API by running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

and 

```bash
flask run --port=5000 --debug
```
