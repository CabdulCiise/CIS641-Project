# Change Management Plan

This document contains details regarding how to integrate this new application with the existing infrastructure for a business as well as the steps that will be taken to onboard users to the system.

Firstly, the development team will put together a video showing off the new application and will disseminate the video to the whole team. Additionally, the dev team will put together a show and tell meeting with team leaders to get them further familiar with the new application and give them an opportunity to ask questions directly. Each team leader will then be asked to use the application for a small period of time and provide feedback write within the application.

Moreover, the dev team will utilize the train the trainer method where each team leaders will be expected to lead a meeting with their teams while a representative from the dev team is present to help step in if needed.

Because this system is not replacing an exisiting one, there will not be a need to rollback the release of the new system. Once the application is released and is fully integrated into the ecosystem, the dev team will monitor user feedback real-time from the database.

The system will be deployed to an on-prem server that will host the application. Each user will be provided a shortcut to be able to run the console sapplication locally on their system.
