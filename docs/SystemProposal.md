# Introduction
In today's information-saturated world, consumers are overwhelmed with vast amounts of data to sift through. The primary goal is to get accurate answers swiftly, without the inconvenience of going through endless content. Thanks to AI advancements, consumers can now engage with intelligent bots, getting precise answers in moments instead of going through extensive catalogues or documents.

Our team proposes the development of software designed to take in a collection of PDFs specific to a business–like a furniture manufacturing company, for example–and, coupled with AI capabilities, provide accurate responses to users. This cross-industry solution aims to reduce customer call volumes as well as incorrect product orders and returns, and boost overall customer satisfaction.

Our initial step involves exploration of the current AI landscape, specifically focusing on AI's ability to answer queries derivided from multiple PDFs. If a viable option is not already on the market that can be integrated as a standalone console app, then our approacah would be to construct a minimum viable product (MVP) utilizing the OpenAI API.

The end product should, at the very least, be an application capable of taking in multiple PDFs, accepting user queries and responding in a legible fashion.

# Anticipated Technologies
* Existing AI chat bots that process multiple PDFs
* Open AI API
* C#
* Visual Studio
* Various .NET Core libraries
* Postman

# Method/Approach
1. Throwaway prototyping will be used extensively
2. Team will also be using agile development process
2. Exploring current solutions out on the market
3. As the project kicks off, we will be interviewing potential businesses that may utilize this software
4. Once project is completed, we will be utilizing questionaires for beta testers

# Estimated Timeline
1. Exploring what other solutions are out there - 1 week
2. Setup repo for console app - 1 week
3. Integrating API to process PDF content - 1 week
4. AI training - 1 week
5. Implementing feedback from others - 2 week

# Anticipated Problems
Having done minimum research into what other solutions are on the market currently, the team would have to design an application utilizing the OpenAI API and it may be a bit involved and complex. The goal is to do the benchmarking steps as soon as possible and get started on the technical side such that we can do some throw away prototypes to get our feet wet with these new technologies.
